		os-assignment1  --->   Makefile

In src folder, I have created 6 files. 
	
	Forkmain.c is the solution for problem that is mentioned in pdf. 
	prob1.c - solution for 1,2,3 in 3.8
	prob4.c - solution for problem 4 in 3.8
	prob5.c - solution for problem 5
	prob6.c - solution for problem 6
	prob7.c - solution for problem 7
	prob8.c - solution for problem 8
	
	
To run the project cd to os-assignment1 folder: make all

All the executables will be generated 

./ass1 -n processcount or ./ass1 -h or ./ass1 -p for the pdf problem

./prob1 processcount - #prob1

To remove object files: make clean
