The structure in hoare server is 
		
		bachina.1  --->   Makefile
							   src
							   Readme
							   Answers.txt
							 

In src folder, I have created 6 files. 
	
	Forkmain.c is the solution for problem that is mentioned in pdf. 
	prob1.c - solution for 1,2,3 in 3.8
	prob4.c - solution for problem 4 in 3.8
	prob5.c - solution for problem 5
	prob6.c - solution for problem 6
	prob7.c - solution for problem 7
	prob8.c - solution for problem 8
	
	
To run the project cd to bachina.1 folder: make all

All the executables will be generated 

./ass1 -n processcount or ./ass1 -h or ./ass1 -p for the pdf problem

./prob1 processcount - #prob1

For Prob5 ./prob5 -n processcount -k loopcount -m sleeptime
	--- ./prob5 -n2 -k4 -m10

For prob 8 ./prob8 -n processes - m charactercount
	--- ./prob8 -n2 -m4

To remove object files: make clean
